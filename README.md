# Arcade-Gesture-Recognition-Game
This arcade game uses real-time hand gesture recognition to challenge players to mimic gestures like "Thumbs Up" or "Rock and Roll." Built with Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pygame, it detects gestures through a webcam and rewards players with game visuals and sound effects.
